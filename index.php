            <h2>The Wild Conspiracy Theory That the Titanic Never Sank</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="post_body">
            <p>The sister ships (and their third counterpart, the Britannic) were owned by White Star Line. The Olympic was put into service in June, 1911. She collided with another ship, the HMS Hawke, in September of 1911 and both ships were badly damaged. The accident was a financial disaster for White Star Line, as they were found to be liable for the accident and had to pay for the damages to both ships and legal fees for court cases associated with the accident. Repairs on the Olympic took nearly two months and parts intended for the Titanic, which was still being built during this time, had to be given to the Olympic instead. Only a few weeks after being returned to service, the Olympic suffered another minor incident where one of the propellers broke off and pieces intended for the Titanic were once again cannibalized.</p>

            <h2>What conspiracy theory will you passionately defend?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="post_body">

            <p>Area 51 has been, since its inception, an area for developing and testing advanced weaponry, ballistics, and flight technology. The rumors of it being the crash site of an alien vessel were started by a conspiracy theorist who had read a few too many pulp novels. See, at the time, the facility had been hard at work on stealth aircraft... and one model didn't fare so well. It crashed, and there was an immediate cover-up, meant to hide the new technology from any enemies of the state.</p>
